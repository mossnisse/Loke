# Open questions

Decisions that are deliberately not yet made are recorded here rather than left implicit in normative prose. [`design.md`](design.md) defines the rules implementations must follow for the current language version; these questions concern possible later changes.

Design rationale and differences from Odin are recorded in [comments.md](comments.md).

## Compiler review (2026-10-14)

The [stage-by-stage compiler review](compiler-review-2026-10-14.md) records
correctness, robustness, optimization, simplification, structure, and verification
results. Confirmed language divergences are tracked separately in
[Known gaps](known-gaps.md#gaps), with minimal reproductions. No implementation
changes are included in the review. Its gaps, engineering findings and
simplifications have since been fixed; one finding remains a question.

### Does an unused allocator argument back an owning result?

The review's G14 reads
[Allocator regions and region provenance](design.md#allocator-regions-and-region-provenance)
as giving a direct call's owning result only the regions its body's summary
names, so this would be accepted:

```loke
package main;
import "core:mem";
ignore :: proc(unused: Allocator) -> Box(int) { return box(1); }
outer :: proc() -> Box(int) {
    arena := mem.Arena.init();
    return ignore(arena.allocator());
}
main :: proc() { _ = outer(); }
```

It is L0592 today: `prov_call_region` in [cfg_provenance.odin](src/cfg_provenance.odin)
treats an owning result of any call passed an allocator as "built with" it.
The corpus depends on that reading: `tests/err/m5b_regions.loke`,
`m5b_provenance_regressions.loke`, `m5b_provider_activation.loke`, and
`m7_destructure_regions.loke` use a `make_buffer(value, allocator)` that
ignores its allocator as a constructor whose result the allocator backs.
Following the body instead makes those rejections disappear. The signature
reading lets a constructor start using its allocator without breaking its
callers; the body reading accepts more programs. The spec sentence "an owning
result built with an allocator parameter" fits both, so it should say which.

Measure affected compilation/working-set workloads before and after performance
fixes, as described in
[Testing and verification](compiler-architecture.md#testing-and-verification).

## Package and import versioning

Should import paths encode package versions? And should a package declaration remain mandatory in every file, when every file in a directory must name the same package anyway, or is it ceremony? The current version requires the declaration and leaves dependency versions to the build system or package manager. A future package design may need reproducible version selection without making source imports depend on a particular registry.

Decided so far, and built as `loke.project` (compiler-guide.md "Projects"):

- Imports carry no version and no location. A project gives each dependency a
  name, and the name is a collection prefix: `import "json:parse";`. Where
  `json` comes from is the project's business, so moving or vendoring it
  changes one manifest line and no source.
- One name names one directory in the whole program, across every
  dependency's manifest. A conflict is an error rather than two copies of a
  package, because two copies would give one type two identities. The names
  are one flat space, so a program can import a dependency of a dependency
  without requiring it; a later version may require the direct `require`.
- The manifest is plain `require <name> <path>` lines, trivial to parse now and
  in a self-hosted compiler.
- Dependencies are local directories. When versioned sources arrive (a git
  URL and tag, fetched into a cache outside the compiler front end), the
  version chosen is the highest minimum any manifest asks for, as Go's minimal
  version selection does: deterministic without a solver. Version selection
  alone does not pin source content: the lock must record the selected source,
  version, immutable commit ID, and content checksum for every dependency, as
  planned in [Packages and dependencies](future-plans.md#packages-and-dependencies).

## The `op`/`try_op` pair

Should a container keep both spellings of a fallible operation? `append`/`try_append`, `reserve`/`try_reserve`, and the rest double the container API over a failure-policy choice. Typed fallibility made the fallible variant cheap — a `try_` operation reports failure as a `Result` rather than a bare `bool`, over an ordinary library union with `@(failure=...)` and no compiler-known error type — which is what makes keeping both spellings need re-justifying. Every shipped container keeps its pair today; collapsing them is a separate decision with its own migration.

The language pairs a fallible operation with a policy-following one in a second place: the compiler-generated [`clone`/`try_clone`](design.md#lifecycle-hooks-and-resource-types). The shape is identical, so the two are one question asked twice — but they are not one answer, for two reasons that the container pair does not share.

The pair costs a type author nothing. Both names are generated from the single `hook(copy)` role, so a record supplies one implementation and receives both spellings; a container supplies two implementations, two doc entries, and two test paths per operation. Duplication in the generated pair is two names, not two bodies.

And the policy-following half is load-bearing rather than convenient. Copy assignment of a copyable type is *defined* as `try_clone` plus the [allocation failure policy](design.md#allocation-failure), and [`Cloneable`](design.md#standard-interface-catalogue) names the fallible slot, so both halves already have language-level jobs. Deleting `clone` would not remove the policy call, only move it to every call site that copies. A container `try_op` carries no equivalent obligation, which is what leaves the container pair the live half of the question.

The allocation built-ins are a third instance, and they keep the pair: `box`/`try_box`, `make`/`try_make`, and `unsafe.new`/`unsafe.try_new` (see [The allocation built-ins follow the `try_` convention](comments.md#the-allocation-built-ins-follow-the-try_-convention)).

## Pure procedures

Should there be a form of procedure, distinct from `proc`, that is guaranteed by the compiler to be free of side effects?

Compile-time evaluation no longer requires a second procedure kind: an ordinary
procedure is evaluated contextually when its executed path is admissible. A
separate purity contract could still permit safe runtime reordering, parallel
reactive evaluation, and clearer contracts on operations such as `hash` and
`compare`. The cost remains an effect system, especially once useful pure code
is allowed local mutation and result allocation. It is not required by the
current compile-time or interface design.

## Callable records, procedures, and closures

A record with a `call` method is the callable convention: `x(args)` calls it
([Calling a value](design.md#calling-a-value)),
[`interfaces.Callable`](design.md#standard-interface-catalogue) lets one generic
signature accept a procedure or such a record, and a
[capture literal](design.md#capture-literals) declares the record from a
clause, and a [`dyn proc` view](design.md#borrowed-callable-views) erases
either. Their rationale is in [comments.md](comments.md#capture-literals) and
[comments.md "Borrowed callable views"](comments.md#borrowed-callable-views).
What stays open follows.

A callable that outlives its creation scope is a separate ownership question.
`fmt.Writer` and `log.Logger` do not establish a need for one: a formatter lends
its sink for the call, and a logger lends process-lifetime storage, both through
[`dyn mut` views](comments.md#formatting-and-logging-sinks-are-dyn-views).

### What a capture literal's `call` cannot do

A literal's `call` takes a plain `self`, so it reads its captures and writes
through `&mut` ones.
What a plain `self` cannot do is keep mutable state inside the callable, or
hand a capture away when called and so be callable once. Both matter only for
a callable that outlives its scope: a stored generator, a deferred job, a
thread worker. Those wait on
[Owning runtime polymorphism](#owning-runtime-polymorphism) and
[Thread transfer needs a visible contract](#thread-transfer-needs-a-visible-contract).
Revisit `inout` and `move` calls when the first API takes such a callable; the
receiver mode is then written, for example on the clause.

### Returning a capture literal

No signature can name a capture literal's type, so it cannot be returned or
held in a file-scope type.
A callable that is returned or kept past its frame is either a file-scope
record written by hand or an owning erased value under
[Owning runtime polymorphism](#owning-runtime-polymorphism). Revisit when the
first returned closure is needed. One answer then is an opaque result type,
`-> some interfaces.Callable(proc(a, b: int) -> bool)`, as Rust's `-> impl Fn` is; it makes a caller depend
on the body for the result's size, which works against
[Public borrow contracts should stand on their own](#public-borrow-contracts-should-stand-on-their-own),
and it overlaps an owning `dyn`.

### Compile-time capture literals

Compile-time evaluation rejects a capture literal, as having no compile-time
value. Its record could be evaluated as any record is; support it when a
compile-time use appears.

### A mutable callable view

A [`dyn proc` view](design.md#borrowed-callable-views) is read-only, since a
`call` takes a plain `self`: it reads its captures and writes through a `&mut`
one. Revisit `dyn mut proc` with the `inout` call in
[What a capture literal's `call` cannot do](#what-a-capture-literals-call-cannot-do):
a callable that keeps mutable state inside itself would need a mutable view to
be called through one.

## Owning runtime polymorphism

Borrowed `dyn Interface` views are now defined. Should a later version add an
owning erased value, and if so should it be a language type such as `Box(dyn I)`
or a library owner built over an exposed witness primitive?

A closure that is returned or kept past its frame is a concrete use: a
[capture literal](design.md#capture-literals) and its borrowed
[`dyn proc` view](design.md#borrowed-callable-views) cannot leave the body
that wrote it.

The proposal must specify allocator identity, alignment, fallible construction,
move, clone, drop, thread-affine destruction, and whether inline small-object
storage changes representation. Borrowed `dyn` intentionally settles none of
those questions and never allocates. The decided
[`Box(T)`](design.md#owned-values) settles them
for a payload whose type is known; `Box(dyn I)` would still need erased clone
and drop, and the payload's size and alignment from the witness.

Note that the witness is currently a mechanism with no user-visible spelling: the
compiler builds one for each `(Interface, Concrete, arguments...)` tuple reached
by a `dyn` conversion, and nothing materializes it as a value. An earlier draft
exposed `witness_of` and a compiler-defined `Witness(...)` type for exactly this
future owner, which meant fixing a layout, a zero value, an invalid-witness panic
rule, and a normative slot-flattening order for a consumer that did not exist.
Whichever way the question above is answered, the primitive comes back with the
owner that needs it.

## Concurrency refinements

The current [memory model](design.md#concurrency-and-the-memory-model) defines data races, atomics, transfer between threads, and `Shared(T)`. Experience with a real concurrent runtime should determine whether later versions need compiler-checked `Send` or `Sync` interfaces, additional atomic orderings, or a thread-affine owning type for code that wants non-atomic reference counts.

The cost of keeping immutable `string` safe to copy and drop across threads is treated separately under [Thread-affine strings](#thread-affine-strings).

Higher-level constructs are a separate question: futures or a similar
composable asynchronous result, and language help for reactivity, such as a
procedure rerun when a variable it reads changes. Each needs a use of its own;
[Thread transfer needs a visible contract](#thread-transfer-needs-a-visible-contract)
already rules them out as the answer to borrowing across a join.

## Thread-affine strings

`string` is an owning value that may share backing storage, and the current
version requires atomic handle accounting in any sharing implementation. This is
the most expensive rule in the language per line of ordinary code: every string
copy is a potential atomic increment, and a freestanding target without atomics
is left with copy-always as the only conforming strategy. Atomic accounting does
not make an arbitrary allocator thread-safe; transferring the string still
asserts that its bound allocator may deallocate on the receiving thread.

A thread-affine string with a non-atomic count would be a distinct type rather
than a silent weakening of the guarantee. Deciding whether it is needed requires
measuring a real implementation; it is recorded here because the cost is
structural rather than an implementation detail, and because the answer affects
whether `string` is usable unchanged on embedded targets.

## Compile-time code generation

The current language evaluates ordinary procedures at compile time, treats
types as typed compile-time values, exposes typed reflection descriptors, and
supports statement-level static `foreach`. It deliberately does not expose
tokens or syntax trees, generate identifiers, inject declarations, or expand a
static loop at file scope.

Experience with serialization, GUI, RPC, and binding libraries should determine
whether typed reflection and expansion are sufficient. If declaration
generation is eventually required, it should preserve lexical name resolution,
hygiene, incremental compilation, and readable diagnostics rather than exposing
an untyped token macro system by default.

## Recoverable panics

Loke makes a panic unrecoverable: unwinding runs `defer`s and managed
`drop`s for cleanup, but there is no `recover`, `try`, or catch construct that
lets Loke code observe or resume from one. The [panic semantics](design.md#panics-and-unwinding)
are otherwise fully defined, including the two build-selected strategies.

The open question is whether a later version should add a bounded recovery
mechanism — a per-thread catch at a task or request boundary, say — without
reintroducing general exceptions. The appeal is server code that wants to fail
one request rather than the process; the cost is a second control-flow path that
every `drop` hook and `defer` would have to be correct under, and the temptation
to use it as ordinary error handling in place of [`or_return`](design.md#or_return-operator).
Not required by anything in this document.

## exponent operator

 ** for pow(a,b)? ^ are used for pointers.

## intrinsics and inline assembly

How to add some suport to go even more low level and use SIMD efficiently, Intrinsic or inline assembly?

## abstraction over SOA

Is it the programers responsibility to abstract ove the right thing or does the language need some help with that?

## LLM optimization

token optimization, can the syntax be made to be token efficient?
LLM readability and writability, how does that differ from humans? LLM's are trained on human data but works differently.
Encapsulation and abstractions must still be important so they can work on an part of the code.

## garbage collection

add an garbage collected allocator as an alternative?

## Symbolic links before `core:fs` supports them

standard-library.md "`core:fs`" says symbolic links are unsupported and that
their behavior, when it arrives, will be explicit rather than Windows's. Until
then `fs.metadata` reports what `GetFileAttributesExW` says about the link
itself. A junction reads as a `Directory`. A file link reads as the link, which
Windows documents as describing the link rather than its target, though opening
it reads the target. `Kind.Other` is never produced.

Should a reparse point read as `Other` now? That would be explicit. It would
also make `create_directories` fail through a junction, which ordinary Windows
profiles contain.

## Open questions in `core:strconv`

- `parse_f64` rounds through the C library's `strtod`, as `fmt` already does to
  find its shortest spellings. That makes it foreign code, which design.md
  "Compile-time procedure evaluation" keeps out of constants for good, and it
  reads the decimal point of the C locale, which a program that calls
  `setlocale` through a foreign binding can change. A correctly rounded parser
  in Loke (Eisel-Lemire with a big-decimal fallback) would fix both. Is either
  worth that much code?

## Formatting

The current formatter rules and rationale are in [comments.md "Formatting"](comments.md#formatting).

Open: aligning columns automatically, as `gofmt` does, so a renamed field
does not leave its neighbours misaligned; and indenting a continued line
inside brackets, which `core/` leaves at the bracket's level.

## Keywords reserved in every position

[grammar.md "Keywords"](grammar.md#keywords) reserves 36 words in every
position, and only a few (`self`, `slot`, `using`, `delegate`, the `hook` roles)
are contextual. Some reserved words are also common names: writing
`examples/lexer.loke`, a procedure could not be called `operator`. A
self-hosted compiler would meet this throughout. Counting declarations that use
one as a name (`name :=`, `name:`, `name,`) in the Odin compiler's `src/`:
`type` about 970, `hook` 27, `operator` 20, `in` 16, `dyn` 11, `via` 9.

Should words that only begin a construct in one position, such as `operator`,
`hook`, `via`, `where`, and perhaps `type`, become contextual, like `delegate`
already is? The cost is parser lookahead and error recovery that has to tell a
name from the keyword, and diagnostics that can no longer say "expected a name,
found keyword" there.

## Language design review (2026-10-03)

This is a set of proposals, not an amendment to the normative specification.
Backward compatibility is deliberately not a constraint. The review examined
the specification, grammar, rationale, existing open questions, compiler
architecture, relevant checker/emitter code, standard-library APIs, examples,
and focused compiler probes. It is not a proof of compiler soundness or a
performance benchmark.

Loke already has a strong foundation: deterministic evaluation order, lexical
cleanup, checked indexing and signed arithmetic, closed enums, exhaustive
union switches, explicit fallibility, definition-site generic lookup, and no
user-defined implicit conversions. Preserve those. The largest simplification
would come from making ownership, capability, and safety rules compose with
fewer exceptions, rather than shortening keywords.

### Recommended order

| Priority | Proposal | Main benefit | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Next | Compiler-selected ordinary union layout | Compact nested results | Representation contract |
| Next | Stable written borrow contracts | Public signatures do not depend on implementation bodies | Procedure types |
| Later | Localize unchecked operations | Unsafe obligations are visible where introduced | Syntax and APIs |
| Later | Checked disjoint access | Hand mutable halves to parallel workers | One compiler-known slice operation |
| Later | Checked thread transfer and scoped workers | Reduce races and permit borrowed parallel work | Thread APIs and capabilities |

Try each on concrete programs before deciding: a parser, a resource container,
a sorting or partitioning algorithm, and a parallel numeric kernel.

### Put unchecked obligations at their operation

The current [unsafe boundary](design.md#the-unsafe-package) is a file import.
Once a file imports `core:unsafe`, every unchecked pointer conversion and
C-pointer access in it is permitted, not only the one that needed it. Most
unchecked operations are already named at their use (`unsafe.raw_data`,
`unsafe.take`); the syntax forms are the exception. `x: T = ---` and
`@(initialized)` storage now need the import too.

**Proposal:** add a lexical `unsafe { ... }` boundary for unchecked pointer
use and unchecked calls. An unsafe procedure declaration should mean that its
caller owes a stated precondition; an ordinary wrapper can establish it
internally. The spelling is proposed syntax, not syntax accepted today. It
pays once a library exposes a procedure with a caller-owed precondition; none
outside `core:unsafe` does yet, and the files that import `core:unsafe` are
mostly OS wrappers that would wrap nearly every procedure.

Raw pointer constness is a separate idea: a C pointer currently loses both
provenance and read-only capability. Consider `[^]T` for read-only foreign
access and `[^]mut T` for writing, with an unchecked cast required to
strengthen capability. It would change every foreign signature in `core`, and
foreign pointer use would still require lifetime and bounds obligations;
constness alone does not establish either.

### Provide checked disjoint access

Two runtime slice ranges conservatively overlap, so two *mutable* halves of
one sequence cannot be live at once: after `left := &mut xs[:mid]`, the
reborrow suspends `xs`, and `&mut xs[mid:]` is `L0641`.

Most algorithms do not need that. A recursive merge sort compiles today:
recursing on one half and then the other (`sort(&mut xs[:mid]);
sort(&mut xs[mid:]);`) ends each reborrow before the next, the merge reads
both halves at once as read-only views (allowed since
[Weakening and reborrows](design.md#weakening-and-reborrows) lets reads of a
carrier coexist), and a swap across the halves is `xs.swap(i, j)`. What
remains impossible is handing each half to its own worker, which needs
[scoped workers](#thread-transfer-needs-a-visible-contract) first. Do this
together with them.

**Proposal:** a compiler-known `xs.split_at_mut(mid)` on `[]mut T`, built like
`swap`: one bounds check, two slice headers, and a result whose two fields are
one mutable reborrow of `xs`. No disjointness relation needs tracking. The one
reborrow keeps `xs` suspended until both halves are finished, so the source
can be neither written nor reallocated meanwhile; writes through the two
halves do not conflict, because suspension constrains uses of the source and
not of its reborrows; and copying one half twice is already rejected, as a
second reborrow of the same field. Acceptance tests should reject a write
through `xs`, reallocation of its owner, and a half retained beyond `xs`.

A library function cannot provide this. Written with `unsafe.raw_data`, a
`split_at_mut` compiles and works, but its halves carry no provenance, so
`values.append(5)` and `xs[0] = 9` are accepted while they are live: a
use-after-reallocation the compiler cannot see. Written with checked slicing,
its body needs the two simultaneous reborrows it is meant to provide.

Related expressiveness limits are real but need different tools. A graph or
arena can use stable integer/generational handles without pervasive pointers.
A record owning a buffer and views into itself needs address stability and an
internal-borrow contract; non-null pointers do not solve it. Prefer offsets
and handles before introducing general pinning or self-referential types.

### Performance opportunities and actual semantic limits

Fast programs are expressible: fixed contiguous arrays, slices, arena-backed
owners, monomorphized generics, static iteration, explicit moves, and
`Simd(T, N)` provide the necessary building blocks. However, no benchmark in
this review establishes that the current compiler achieves C-like performance.

| Area | Current consequence | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bounds/overflow checks | Observable failure constrains motion and speculation | Keep checks; eliminate those proved redundant and expose explicit arithmetic policies. References are [never null](design.md#types-with-no-zero-value), so they carry no nil checks |
| Aliasing | Local exclusivity can help; unknown provenance and hidden effects limit what may be assumed | Repair effect holes first, then emit alias/memory attributes only where their precise obligations hold |
| Floating-point expressions | Unwritten FMA contraction and reassociation are forbidden | Add explicit `math.fma` and separately named reassociating reductions; keep default arithmetic strict |
| Ordered reductions | A floating SIMD sum is defined left to right | Retain the ordered form and offer an explicit unordered/tree reduction with documented numerical differences |
| Custom clone/drop and allocators | Calls may have observable effects or fail | Define which implicit copies may be elided; preserve explicit clone contracts |
| Dynamic interface dispatch | An unknown witness requires an indirect call | Prefer generic specialization in hot code; devirtualize when a concrete witness is known |
| Atomic string/shared accounting | Cross-thread sharing requires synchronization | Borrow views in hot paths; consider thread-local ownership only after measurement |
| Union representation | Fixed payload-plus-tag layout prevents general niche encoding | Give ordinary unions compiler-selected layout; explicit layout only where requested |

An unused representation, or niche, is a bit pattern no valid payload uses.
For references the niche is decided: null encodes `.none` in an `Option`-shaped
union over a non-null reference
([Representation](design.md#representation)).
What remains here is every other union.

Make the layout of ordinary unions an implementation choice, while retaining
accurate `size_of`, alignment, reflection, and consistent ABI within a build.
An explicit representation contract can preserve a stable tag and field layout
for serialization or external consumers. Do not expose an unstable optimized
representation as a wire format. Nested `Result(Option(T), E)` is another
candidate for compact representation, subject to its actual payload states.

The emitted-IR source does not currently spell general `noalias`/`readonly`
parameter attributes. That is an implementation opportunity, not evidence that
LLVM never infers them. Read-only capability alone is insufficient to promise
memory cannot change: atomic operations intentionally write through read-only
receivers, and foreign/unchecked aliases need their own contract. Follow
[LLVM's attribute requirements](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#parameter-attributes)
precisely rather than applying them to every `mut` or read-only type.

Some transformations really are forbidden. Turning ordered floating additions
into a different reduction tree, silently fusing `a*b+c`, or hoisting a possible
panic ahead of earlier observable writes can change the specified result.
That does not mean all vectorization is forbidden: independent iterations,
proofs that checks cannot fail, runtime alias checks, and target-supported
ordered reductions remain available. LLVM documents these distinctions in its
[vectorization guide](https://llvm.org/docs/Vectorizers.html).

Do not add a general purity/effect language merely to request faster code.
Start with the inferred effects already needed for safety, explicit numerical
operations, and measurements of bounds checks, allocation counts, retained
strings, generated code, and representative kernels.

### Public borrow contracts should stand on their own

[Procedure result contracts](design.md#procedure-result-contracts) can capture
precise dependencies, but `type_of(procedure)` ties a public callback contract
to that procedure's inferred body. A handwritten procedure type loses details;
`@(escape=none)` excludes whole arguments but cannot name a specific result
field's source or every allocator dependency.

**Proposal:** add a small written result-source contract, with syntax to be
designed, that says a result borrows specified parameter paths or is backed by
a named allocator parameter. Check the body against it. Keep inference as the
default for local helpers and an IDE/documentation aid.

This lets changing an implementation preserve its declared public contract,
and permits callbacks without manufacturing a reference implementation solely
to use its `type_of`. It can also reduce dependence on whole-program inference
as separate compilation develops. It does not require lifetime variables on
every local declaration.

The [minimum provenance budgets](design.md#minimum-provenance-precision) are
another source of surprises: four projection steps, eight distinguished fixed
array elements, and four constant map keys. A harmless wrapper or extra entry
can turn accepted code into a conservative rejection. Keep diagnostics naming
the limit, add acceptance tests just beyond each boundary, and make written
contracts/disjoint primitives reduce dependence on inferred shape. Raising
numeric limits alone does not solve this architectural issue.

### Thread transfer needs a visible contract

[The memory model](design.md#concurrency-and-the-memory-model) deliberately leaves
data races, thread-affine destruction, and allocator thread compatibility to
the programmer. An atomic reference count does not make its payload or bound
allocator safe to use on another thread. The current `thread.spawn` also uses
`@(escape=static)`, so joining its handle is not sufficient to let a worker
borrow an ordinary local slice.

**Proposal:** initially make unchecked cross-thread transfer explicit. A later
checked API can validate recursive transfer/share capabilities, with opt-outs
for foreign handles and custom lifecycle hooks and an explicit contract for
allocator deallocation on another thread. A type-only `Send` predicate is not
enough when two values of the same owning type may use different allocators.

Add scoped workers only with a scope-owned join guarantee, enabling disjoint
borrowed slices to be processed before the parent continues. That guarantee
must survive ordinary early exits and leaked/dropped user handles; relying
solely on a handle's destructor is insufficient when `unsafe.forget` can skip
it. Process termination may end the guarantee because no parent continues.
Do not add futures, async syntax, or reactive variables merely to solve this
borrow-and-join problem. See [Concurrency refinements](#concurrency-refinements).

## Language design review (2026-10-11)

A second set of proposals, not an amendment to the specification. The review
read design.md and grammar.md in full, checked each idea against comments.md
and the questions above, and confirmed every behavior it cites with the
shipped compiler at `1ba3c84`. Backward compatibility is not a constraint; a
proposal that reverses a recorded decision says so. The compiler/spec
divergence it found, rune constants converting to floating-point types, has
since been fixed.

The core holds together: one capability axis spelled `mut`, non-null
references with `Option` niches, fallibility by union shape, exhaustive
switches, checked arithmetic and conversions, definition-site lookup, and
hermetic compile-time evaluation. Most proposals were about where everyday code
meets that core: printing, map keys, early exits, error plumbing, and
temporaries. The structural concern is that more checking depends on inferred,
whole-program facts than a library's signatures show; see
[No public mutable globals](#no-public-mutable-globals) and
[Public borrow contracts should stand on their own](#public-borrow-contracts-should-stand-on-their-own).

### Adopted

These proposals, the ones ranked "Next" and the smaller items since, were
adopted. design.md defines each under the headings named, and comments.md
records the reasoning:

- `in` tests ranges, which bind tighter than comparison ("Ranges",
  "Operator precedence").
- `or_else` may `break`, `continue`, or `return` ("or_else expression").
- A `package main` prints its fields and cannot be imported ("Exported
  names").
- A checked pointer prints as its referent ("String format printing").
- A record that keeps its generated `==` gets a generated `hash` ("Maps").
- `main` may return a fallible union ("Program entry and exit").
- An anonymous record whose fields are ordered orders lexicographically
  ("Comparison operators").
- References and owning handles are together the non-null types, which the
  `Option` niche covers ("Types with no zero value", "Representation").
- The handle types are `Box(T)`, `Shared(T)`, and `Weak(T)`; `box` and
  `shared` are only constructors ("Owned values", "Shared ownership").
- A temporary that a local's declaration or whole assignment borrows lives
  until its block ends ("Temporaries and procedure boundaries").
- A case binds a record payload's fields, `case .add(left, right):`, borrowed
  over a place and transferred over a temporary ("Inspecting a union", "Switch
  ownership").
- The [error handling proposal](#error-handling-2026-10-13), which replaced
  declared error wrapping and settled the failure-only `defer`: a failure
  operand after `or_return`, `Status(E)`, a body that ends in its payloadless
  success, and `errdefer` ("The failure operand", "Typed fallibility", "One
  result", "defer statement").

### Recommended order

| Priority | Proposal | Main benefit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Later | Checked unsigned arithmetic | Wraps become panics; reverses a decision |
| Later | No public mutable globals | Effects stop crossing packages invisibly |
| Later | Test procedures | Unit tests for package-private code |

### Checked unsigned arithmetic

Signed `+`, `-`, and `*` panic on overflow; unsigned ones wrap. The compiler
prints `4294967294` for `u32(3) - u32(5)` and `240` for `u8(' ') - u8('0')`,
and `1 << k` is `0` for `k := -1`. Lengths are `int`, so unsigned values appear
in byte, `u32`, and `u64` code — parsers, codecs, bindings — which is where an
unnoticed wrap does harm. [Signed overflow panics](comments.md#signed-overflow-panics)
keeps unsigned arithmetic modular for hashing and bit manipulation, which
already have `math.wrapping_*` and could take Zig's `+%`, `-%`, and `*%` if the
calls are heavy; the FNV hash in
[Compile-time procedure evaluation](design.md#compile-time-procedure-evaluation)
would need one. Proposal: check unsigned `+`, `-`, and `*` as signed ones are,
keep shifts and atomics modular, and panic on a negative signed shift count,
which a constant count already rejects. This reverses a recorded decision and
costs a check wherever the optimizer cannot discharge it.

### No public mutable globals

[Global write effects](design.md#global-write-effects) are inferred over the
whole program and are not part of a procedure's type. A print takes the union
of every `format` method's effect, a `dyn` call that of every witness for its
slot. A library that adds a write to one of its globals can therefore break a
caller in another package with no signature changed, and incremental checking
must track inferred effects as a dependency that signatures miss.

A caller conflicts only over a global it can borrow. Reject `@(public)` on
mutable file-scope, `static`, and `thread_local` variables, and an importer can
borrow another package's global only through a procedure returning that borrow,
whose result contract already shows static provenance. Effects then cross a
package boundary only for statics a package visibly lends. `core` pays almost
nothing: its one public mutable global, `os.args`, is a zero-sized view that
could be a constant.

### Test procedures

The roadmap's parser and self-hosted compiler need unit tests, and
`core:testing` is an [optional gap](future-plans.md#standard-library-maturity).
A unit test reaches package-private code, which only code in the package can.
Mark zero-argument procedures `@(test)` and compile them only in a test build
that runs each and reports a failed `assert` or `panic` by location. A panic
cannot be caught, so the runner either runs each test in its own process or
stops at the first failure; see [Recoverable panics](#recoverable-panics). Zig's
`test` blocks and Go's `_test.go` files are the precedents; an attribute needs
no new syntax.

## Error handling (2026-10-13)

The error handling proposal of this date is adopted: `or_return` takes a
failure operand that replaces or maps the error, `Status(E)` serves procedures
that only fail and has replaced `Result(Unit, E)` across `core` and the `try_`
operations, such a body may end without `return .ok;`, and `errdefer` runs on a
failure exit and during unwinding. design.md defines them under "The failure
operand", "Typed fallibility", "One result", and "defer statement"; comments.md
records the reasoning and the alternatives not taken. These parts are open:

- **A replacement that discards information.** `f() or_return .Bad` drops the
  error `f` returned. That is explicit at the site, as the switch it replaces
  was, but when the error is not an enum a lint could ask for a mapper.
- **Binding the error in `errdefer`.** Zig's `errdefer |err|` names the error
  being returned. An `errdefer` reads locals today; binding needs a syntax and
  a rule for an error that has moved into the result.
- **Whether `ok_or` keeps a job.** A failure operand covers every propagation
  `ok_or` served and evaluates its error only on failure; `ok_or` remains for
  an `Option` that is stored or passed on. `map_error` keeps the same job for
  a `Result` or `Status`.
- **Generic code over both result shapes.** A procedure generic over
  `Result($T, $E)` does not accept a `Status(E)`, so a library that is generic
  over fallible results may need both forms. A parametric type alias,
  `Status :: Result(Unit, $E)`, would have avoided this, and is worth
  revisiting if aliases gain parameters for another reason.
