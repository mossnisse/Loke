# Known gaps

Divergences between the specification documents and the shipped compiler, with
a minimal reproduction for each. A gap leaves this file when the compiler
accepts the program the spec describes — not when the spec is reworded to match
the compiler, unless the rewording is the intended fix.

## Gaps

### Every statement is taken to be able to panic

[design.md "Panics and unwinding"](design.md#panics-and-unwinding) runs the
registered cleanups only when a panic happens. The checker models that unwind
from the start of every statement while a `defer` is registered, including
statements that cannot panic, so it rejects a cleanup order that only an
impossible panic would get wrong. This program is valid, since neither the
`if` condition nor dropping a `[dynamic]int` can panic, but `defer drop(arena)`
is `L0537`:

```odin
package main;
import "core:mem";
dropped_first :: proc(flag: bool) -> int {
    arena := mem.Arena.init();
    xs: [dynamic]int via arena.allocator() = {};
    defer drop(arena);      // L0537: a panic could unwind it before `xs`
    if (flag) {
        drop(xs);
        return 1;
    }
    drop(xs);
    return 2;
}
main :: proc() { _ = dropped_first(true); }
```

Registering the `defer` before `xs` is accepted and is the safer order anyway.
Narrowing the unwind points to the operations that can panic (calls, checked
indexing and arithmetic, conversions) would accept the program as written.
