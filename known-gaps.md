# Known gaps

Divergences between the specification documents and the shipped implementation,
with a minimal reproduction for each. A gap leaves this file when the
implementation matches the specified behavior — not when the spec is reworded
to match a bug, unless the rewording is the intended fix.

## Gaps

### A copy out of a dynamic array's view suspends the other elements' carriers

[Weakening and reborrows](design.md#weakening-and-reborrows) makes elements
of a local view at different constant indices different places wherever it
is known where the view starts, as it is for a fresh `&mut d[:]` of a
dynamic array, and a carrier copied out of one element is no use of the
carrier stored in another. Over a dynamic array, the second copy here is
still rejected:

```loke
package main;
Node :: struct { value: int }
List :: struct { head: ^mut Node }
through_dynamic_view :: proc() {
    a := Node{1}; b := Node{2};
    lists := [dynamic]List{List{&mut a}, List{&mut b}};
    s := &mut lists[:];
    node := s[0].head;
    other := s[1].head; // L0641; should be accepted
    other^.value = 3;
    node^.value = 1;
}
main :: proc() {}
```

The same copies compile over a fixed `[2]List`, and a borrow of `s[0]`
beside a write of `s[1]` compiles over the dynamic array too. The carriers
stored in a dynamic array's elements share one set of content slots
(`carrier_shape_walk` in [src/borrow.odin](src/borrow.odin) gives every
element one wildcard step), so a load naming one element of the view still
reads what every element holds, and the diagnostic names no analysis budget
as [Minimum provenance precision](design.md#minimum-provenance-precision)
asks of a merge. Copying `lists[0].head` and `lists[1].head` straight out of
the dynamic array is rejected the same way. Telling the elements apart needs
content slots for constant elements of a dynamic array, as a view
parameter's constant elements get caller slots of their own
(`prov_view_element` in [src/cfg_provenance.odin](src/cfg_provenance.odin)).

alone on 2026-10-31.

### A carrier repointed between choices counts its places against both storages

[Minimum provenance precision](design.md#minimum-provenance-precision)
guarantees eight chosen places of each storage. When the carrier the places
are reached through is itself repointed between the choices, the places taken
after it was repointed count against the storage it named before too, so four
places of `s` and five of `t` reached through `p` merge, and the disjoint
write is rejected naming the eight-place limit:

```loke
package main;
Wide :: struct { a: int, b: int, c: int, d: int, e: int, z: int }
Sides :: struct { left: Wide, right: Wide, z: int }
chosen :: proc(s: ^mut Sides, t: ^mut Sides, i: int) -> int {
    p := s;
    q := &mut p^.left.a;
    if (i == 1) { q = &mut p^.left.b; }
    if (i == 2) { q = &mut p^.left.c; }
    if (i == 3) { q = &mut p^.left.d; }
    p = t;
    if (i == 4) { q = &mut p^.left.e; }
    if (i == 5) { q = &mut p^.right.a; }
    if (i == 6) { q = &mut p^.right.b; }
    if (i == 7) { q = &mut p^.right.c; }
    if (i == 8) { q = &mut p^.right.d; }
    value := &q^;
    s^.left.z = 1; // L0641; should be accepted
    return value^;
}
main :: proc() {}
```

Borrowing through `s` and `t` directly is accepted. `Prov_Offset.storage` in
[src/borrow.odin](src/borrow.odin) names the storage a place was reached in
by the carrier slot that named it, and a slot's offsets
(`prov_note_offset` in [src/cfg_provenance.odin](src/cfg_provenance.odin))
gather what every definition of it may point at, so after `p = t` they hold
the whole of `s` as well as of `t`. Counting a place against only the storage
its carrier names where it is taken needs offsets that follow the
definitions reaching each borrow. Found while closing the storage scope of the
chosen-place guarantee on 2026-10-31.
