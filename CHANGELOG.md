# Changelog

User-visible changes to the language, the compiler, and the standard library.
Each release's section is its GitHub release notes. A change lands under
**Unreleased**; tagging `vX.Y.Z` means renaming that heading to `[X.Y.Z]` with
the date and setting `LOKE_VERSION_STRING` in `src/build_config.odin` to match.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.1] - 2026-09-27

The first published release: the v1 language specified by
[design.md](design.md) and [grammar.md](grammar.md), implemented by `lokec` with
no open entries in [known-gaps.md](known-gaps.md).

### Language

- Value semantics with visible ownership: strings, dynamic arrays, and maps are
  managed values with language-defined copy, move, and cleanup, and a copy that
  may allocate is written, never implied.
- Borrows, lifetimes, and places checked by the compiler, without Rust-style
  complete memory safety; explicit `unsafe` marks the trust boundary.
- Records, enums, unions, and methods; operators and indexing defined by
  records; interfaces used both as generic bounds and as erased `dyn` views.
- Monomorphized generics with `where` bounds, compile-time execution, and
  conditional compilation, in place of a preprocessor or macro system.
- Errors as values with `or_return`, `or_else`, and optional-ok, plus panics
  with unwinding.
- Allocators and regions, threads and atomics with a defined memory model, SIMD
  vectors, and C interoperability through the C ABI and C-compatible types.

### Compiler

- `lokec` checks a program or a package directory and builds an executable or
  object through LLVM IR and Clang, at five optimization levels (`-opt=none` to
  `-opt=aggressive`).
- Package imports, `-collection name=path` roots, foreign imports including
  NASM `.asm` sources, `-emit-ll`, `-check-layout`, and `-print-toolchain`.
- Diagnostics with stable codes (`L0001` onwards) and source spans.

### Standard library

- `base:` `runtime`, `meta`, and `interfaces`.
- `core:` `mem`, `unsafe`, `sync`, `simd`, `thread`, `fmt`, `strconv`,
  `strings`, `cstrings`, `encoding/utf16`, `endian`, `math`, `slice`,
  `container`, `log`, `io`, `path`, `fs`, `term`, and `os`, specified in
  [standard-library.md](standard-library.md).

### Platform and limits

- Windows x64 only. Building programs needs LLVM/Clang and the MSVC build tools
  with the Windows SDK; building `lokec` itself needs Odin `dev-2025-09`.
- The release is a zip of `lokec.exe` with the `base/`, `core/`, `runtime/`,
  and `examples/` trees it finds beside itself; unzip it anywhere.
- Not yet available: a package manager, a language server, debug information,
  and Linux or macOS targets ([future-plans.md](future-plans.md)).
